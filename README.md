## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Images were resized, normalized, and augmented to improve model robustness.  

2. **Model Architecture**:  
   - DenseNet-121, known for its compact and efficient design, was used as the base model.  
   - Additional custom classification layers were added for multi-class prediction.  

3. **Training and Evaluation**:  
   - The model was fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of oral disease images.  
   - Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## 🤔 Why DenseNet?  
- **Compact Design**: Fewer layers and better parameter efficiency compared to other architectures.  
- **Feature Propagation**: Directly connects each layer to every other layer, preventing vanishing gradients.  
- **Performance**: Achieved the highest accuracy with faster training times.
